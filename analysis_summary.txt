ANALYSIS SUMMARY: Negative Probabilities and User Position Constraints
================================================================================

ANALYSIS 1: Negative p_segment_t Statistics
================================================================================

Total daily panel files analyzed: 183
Total rows across all panels: 8,801

Key Findings:
- Rows with negative p_segment_t: 3,310 (37.61%)
- Rows with NaN p_segment_t: 1,553 (17.65%)
- Rows with zero/negative denominator (H_Y + H_N <= 0): 1,553 (17.65%)

Breakdown:
- Markets with at least one negative p_segment_t: 83 out of all markets
- Negative p_segment_t by segment:
  * Small: 31 markets
  * Medium: 22 markets
  * Large: 19 markets
  * Whale: 11 markets

Interpretation:
- Negative p_segment_t occurs when H_Y_jt < 0 (more YES sells than buys) 
  and the denominator (H_Y_jt + H_N_jt) is still positive
- NaN occurs when H_Y_jt + H_N_jt <= 0 (net position is zero or negative)
- This happens in 37.61% of all daily panel rows, indicating that segments
  frequently have net negative positions (more selling than buying)

================================================================================
ANALYSIS 2: User Position Analysis (Can users sell more than they buy?)
================================================================================

Total markets analyzed: 48 (first 10 events)
Total unique users: 7,403

Key Findings:
- Users with excess sells (sells > buys): 1,493 (20.17%)
- Markets with at least one user having excess sells: 47 out of 48
- Total excess sell volume: 38,265,155.05 units

Notable Patterns:
- Many users have 0 buys but positive sells (see examples below)
- Some users have buys but still sell more than they bought
- This suggests:
  1. Users may acquire positions through other means (transfers, initial 
     allocations, airdrops, etc.)
  2. The trade data may be incomplete (missing some buy transactions)
  3. Users may be selling positions acquired outside the recorded trade data

Example Cases:
1. User 0x3dddaa07eebb30dbc777cfab052cc0f9bac8722d
   - Market: will-andrew-cuomos-vote-share-be-between-35-and-40...
   - Total Buys: 0.00
   - Total Sells: 20.00
   - Excess: 20.00

2. User 0x58caa2f2787c73901336ce36282a7b28c1a6cc33
   - Market: will-andrew-cuomos-vote-share-be-between-35-and-40...
   - Total Buys: 0.00
   - Total Sells: 90.00
   - Excess: 90.00

3. User 0xe3726a1b9c6ba2f06585d1c9e01d00afaedaeb38
   - Market: will-andrew-cuomos-vote-share-be-between-35-and-40...
   - Total Buys: 0.00
   - Total Sells: 200.46
   - Excess: 200.46

4. User 0x80da08b50ec85bf1f575725091928fff064b4f6d
   - Market: will-andrew-cuomos-vote-share-be-between-40-and-45...
   - Total Buys: 50.00
   - Total Sells: 127.77
   - Excess: 77.77

RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

1. Negative p_segment_t:
   - Current approach allows negative values (as requested)
   - 37.61% of rows have negative values, which is significant
   - Consider segmenting by users (high-value vs low-value users) rather than
     by trades, as this may provide more stable probability estimates

2. User Position Constraints:
   - 20.17% of users have sold more than they bought in the trade data
   - This suggests the trade data may not capture all position acquisition
     methods (transfers, initial allocations, etc.)
   - When implementing user-based segmentation, consider:
     * Including transfer/initial allocation data if available
     * Using net position (buys - sells) rather than just buys to determine
       user value segments
     * Accounting for positions acquired outside recorded trades
